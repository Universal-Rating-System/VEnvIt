VEnvIt is a utility that employs Python and PowerShell scripts to create, initialize, and remove virtual environments tailored for both development and production systems. It provides significant flexibility, allowing users to configure their environments according to specific requirements.

Instead of relying on traditional configuration files (INI, TOML, JSON), VEnvIt uses user-modifiable scripts for settings configuration. This design choice offers greater flexibility and adaptability, enabling fine-grained customization that standard configuration files cannot accommodate.

However, this approach introduces additional complexity and requires a thorough understanding of the application's workings. Proficiency in Python and PowerShell scripting is essential to effectively utilize and configure VEnvIt.
